{"name":"Stream Temperature Modeling","tagline":"Daily stream temperature predictions over broad spatial scales","body":"This is the project folder for the stream temperature work underway at the USGS S.O. Conte Anadromous Fish Research Center in Turners Falls, MA.\r\n\r\nThe stream temperature model estimates effects of landscape variables (% forest cover, % agriculture, elevation, etc.) and time varying variables (solar radiation, snow-water equivalent, air temperature, etc.) on daily stream water temperature. For each site/year combination, the estimates are limited to the times of the year where air temperature and water temperature are synchronized.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
